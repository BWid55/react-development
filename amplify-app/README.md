This is a collection of react work I have created. 
I first created the gratitudes app to learn about API, database connection, and AWS in general.
I then added the portfolio section to better present my work. Plus, I had a lot of fun with the design work involved.

The most extensive project would be the headless e-commerce project.

The most advanced pieces in that project would be the cart (locally hosting all items before being sent for checkout creation, and the custom text product option.
